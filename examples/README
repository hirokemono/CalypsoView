Calypso examples consists of the following three parts.
1. spherical_shell:  Examples to generate varius spherical shell model.
      Chebyshev_points:   Simulation domain with Chebyshev collocation points in outer core
      equidistance:       Simulation domain with equaidistance grids in outer core
      explicitly_defined: Simulation domain with explicitly defined grids
      with_inner_core:    Simulation domain including inner core and external of the fluid shell
      
 To test the program run [CALIPSO_DIR]/bin/gen_sph_grid in each directory.
      
2. dynamo_benchmark: Examples of dynamo benchmark by Christensen et. al.(2001)

3. assemble_sph: Example to conversion spctr data between data with differenct number of parallelization.

4. heat_composition_source: Example to use heat and composition source terms.

5. heterogineous_temp: Example to apply heat and compositional heteroginity at boundaries.
