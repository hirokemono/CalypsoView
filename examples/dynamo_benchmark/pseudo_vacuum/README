!     Example using dynamo benchmark with pseudo vacuum magnetic boundary
!       Please see Jackson et.al. (under the review) for the model description
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
!
 Here is the input files for the dynamo benchmark
 with pseudo vacuum magnetic boundary.
This example consists of the following files and directories.

control_MHD:        control file for simulation
control_snapshot:   control file for data analysis
control_resolution:  control file for spatial resolution

sph_lm31r48c_4:     Directory for spherical harmonics index table
rst_4:              Directory for restart files
field:              Directory for field data files

The simulation procedure is the following

1. Run simulation program
[dynamobench_case_1]$ mpirun -np 4 [CALYPSO_DIR]/bin/sph_mhd

2. To continue the simulation change rst_ctl in control_MHD from
      rst_ctl                pseudo_vacuum_benchmark
   to
      rst_ctl                start_from_rst_file
   And, start simulation again by 2.

4. To check the benchmark solution type 
[dynamobench_case_1]$ mpirun -np 4 [CALYPSO_DIR]/bin/sph_dynamobench

Enjoy!!
