!     Example using heterogeneous heat and compositional boundary conditions
!-----------------------------------------------------------------------
!
Here is the input files to use heterogeneous heat and compositional boundary conditions in Calypso.
To simplify the problem, only the thermal and compositional fields are evolved with no velocity.

This example consists of the following files and directories

control_MHD:        control file for simulation
control_resolution:  control file for spatial resolution

sph_lm4r64c_2:     Directory for spherical harmonics index table
rst_2:              Directory for restart files
field:              Directory for field data files

This example only run with 2 MPI processes. The simulation procedure is the following

1. Run simulation program
[heterogineous_temp]$ mpirun -np 2 [CALYPSO_DIR]/bin/sph_mhd
